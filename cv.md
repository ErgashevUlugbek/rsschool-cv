# Summary
I want to be a software developer and write  powerful and large programs with a team.
When I write a program I  pay a lot of attention to its high performance and speed. 
I love to write fast and high-performance applications.
I believe that each program should be in its optimal state.
I am very self-motivational and flexible person.
I like to work on myself.
My communication, responsibility, teamwork, problem solving, decisiveness,
time managment,
conflict resolution skills are also good.
